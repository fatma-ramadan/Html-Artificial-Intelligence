Let's grasp what intelligence means until it leads to artificial intelligence-Intelligence: ability to understand and problem-solve. The Webster dictionary takes meaning.
The most popular response one would expect is to "make computers smart so you can act smart!" But how smart is the question? How is one able to judge intelligence? As intelligent as humans. If the computers can, somehow, solve real-world problems, by improving on their own from past experiences, they would be called “intelligent”.
Thus, the AI systems are more generic (rather than specific), have the ability to “think” and are more flexible.
